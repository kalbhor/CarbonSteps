<h1>CarbonSteps</h1>

This is a simple Python Flask web app to demonstrate an HTML5 multiple file
uploader application combined with normal form data.<p>

This uses JavaScript to post an Ajax upload to the back-end which gives us a
nice progress bar to see the status of the upload (note: it doesn't break down
the status per-picture, instead it's the status of the entire upload altogether).<p>

A normal <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag is used for the upload. If the user has
JavaScript disabled in their browser, a normal HTTP upload is posted to the
back-end. The same endpoint is used in both cases: when the Ajax request does it,
the server returns a unique ID to the front-end and JavaScript does the redirect.
If the user has scripts disabled, the back-end will initiate the redirect for
them instead.<p>

You can upload files by using the multi-select file upload box (supported in
most browsers and Internet Explorer 10+), or by dragging and dropping files into
the dashed box below (again, in most browsers).<p>

This demo app doesn't do anything with the other form data except for print it
out in the terminal window, but it demonstrates that you <em>can</em> get to the
other form data in addition to the uploaded files.<p>

Only upload <strong>image type files</strong> in the form below.<p>
